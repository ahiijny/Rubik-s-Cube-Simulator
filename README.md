Hey, remember hsa.Console? 

This is a project I made a long time ago. It's a Rubik's cube simulator (in 3D!) with amazing Rubik's cube choices such as the 3x3x3 cube, the 2x2x2 cube, the 1x1x1 cube, and the 0x0x0 cube. 

This needs hsa.Console to run, which means it probably won't run unless you have Ready to Program is installed. Actually, it's not a bad IDE if you're looking for something lightweight and don't mind an extremely obsolete version of Java that is missing all sorts of important features (such as ArrayList...)
